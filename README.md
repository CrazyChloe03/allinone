# ALL IN ONE
calculator program for TI-84 Plus CE

**Extra Info**

u can score using the arrow keys or just press the numbers 1-9 to go to where u want, most of the units are under construction cause i haven't learned them, math section is basically code from the internet cz im too lazy to do it myself, u can find those programs in this [(https://www.ti84calcwiz.com/)](https://www.ti84calcwiz.com/) u can access the older versions of the program in the ALLINONE file (no idea why u would do that), if u do find anything wrong or dumb about the program just message me on teams or email me (email: jerryzhang976@gmail.com) Notes is still development in progress cz tooooo long.





**How to use**

Quadratic equation it is Ax²+Bx+C and signs do matter.\
Free fall time Y0 is the initial height the ball is dropped at, the sign of gravity does not matter.\
Free fall distance and speed is quite straightfoward, just input the gravity and time.\
Free fall range u need to input the resulant velocity (the V in V²=Vx²+Vy²) and the angle in degree, the calculator is automatically put in degree so u dont need to worry about giving the value in radians.\
Free fall angle calculates the resulant velocity and the angle it hits the ground in degrees.\
Parabolic just means the projectile motion but the name is too long to fit in calculator.\
Final velocity just remember its Voy and not V or Vox.\
Max range is in V.\
Max height is in Voy
Max time is the time it takes to go up and down, if ur looking for half the time just divide by 2.\
Max height with initial is just throwing from a cliff, Y0 is initial height.\
Resulant calculator is same as free fall angle.\
Random equations is most (idk) the equations used in this calculator, some is not listed because they are too easy (such as θ=arctan(y/x)).
